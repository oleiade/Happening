# Happening

**Project under heavy development, not yet usable**

Happening is an event-machine designed to handle huge event streams from multiple nodes, while providing multiple data storage backends and a RESTful http API to retrieve and manipulate the stored events. It has been written in Go, consumes very low resources, and is 100% compatible with ARM chipsets in order to be easily embedded on a raspberri pi for example.

It has been initially developed to handle, and help aggregate data incoming from arduino nodes sensors events
